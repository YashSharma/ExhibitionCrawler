http://www.outleads.com,United States,Outleads,"Outleads, a Microsoft Ventures accelerator company, enables advertisers to advertise online based on offline activity. Our patented technology matches data from CRMs, phone, marketing automation, e-mail marketing, and similar software to the ad network's identifiers or cookies so advertisers can leverage it in online advertising. For example, advertisers can target through Google AdWords leads that were sent an e-mail campaign in HubSpot and opened but didn't click it; leads with a certain persona, etc.Outleads pushes data into advertising platforms such as Google AdWords. The ad buyer uses the data to target online advertising; to an ad buyer, the data looks identical to web activity, and can be leveraged in the same way. For example, a buyer can create an audience based on e-mail activity data from HubSpot, and assign this audience to a campaign with higher bids and/or a specific ad creative. The data can also be combined with data from other systems, as well as web activity data. For instance, a buyer may create an audience based on e-mail activity from HubSpot, opportunities in Salesforce, and web visits from the past 30 days.Outleads' patented technology is the first and only to match offsite and offline data directly to ad network cookies or identifiers, integrating with AdWords and ensuring a matching rate of 100% (compared to the industry standard of 20-30%). We communicate information in real-time and automatically, eliminating many of the manual processes associated with traditional data onboarding (like Liveramp, Acxiom, BlueKai, and DataLogix) and delivering significantly greater flexibility.Retargeting with online advertising is proven to be hugely effective with e- commerce, but non-e-commerce companies that advertise online (more than 50% of online ad dollars) can't utilize it as readily because most of their leads' activity isn't web activity - it's activity in systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, Marketo, and Five9. Outleads enables those brands to run retargeting with the same ease, swiftness and power of a purely online operation.Advertisers that use e-mail marketing don't take all of that data - such as marketing lists, e-mail sends, delivers and opens - into account in online ad retargeting. Outleads makes that information available in AdWords so that it gets factored into the online ad buying process.Copyright 2014, a2z, Inc. All rights reserved.","New York, NY"
